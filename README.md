####Part 1: Your Shiny Application

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

The application must include the following:

2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could 5. use your application.
6. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
